This project is a visuzliation-based exploration of child speech from 24-60 months old using the Braunwald data of the CHILDES corpus.

The visualizations explore how the emergence of word classes, divided into content and function words, are related to one another, as well as to the amount of speech produced. Matlib and seaborn plots are used. 

Note: this was a first Python project created with three weeks of code knowledge. The code that could be heavily condensed with the use of repetition structures and functions.
